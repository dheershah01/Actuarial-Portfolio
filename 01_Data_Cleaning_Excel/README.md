# Data Quality Checks in Excel 

**Tools:** Excel (formulas, conditional formatting, data validation)

This project demonstrates data quality checks on a synthetic dataset of 4500+ insurance policies.  
The original dataset was cleaned during my internship at Lux Actuaries Kenya, but all identifiers (names, policy IDs, claim numbers, intermediaries) have been anonymised.

**What the file includes:**
- Duplicate checks (Policy IDs, Claim IDs)
- Missing values flagged with conditional formatting
- Date validation (Issue, Start, Expiry, Loss, Payment dates)
- Range checks for numeric values (e.g., no negative premiums or claims)
- Business rule checks (e.g., Expiry after Start, Loss within coverage)
